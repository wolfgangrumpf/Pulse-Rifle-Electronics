CircuitPython code for the Adafruit Feather TFT Reverse S2 to provide sound and lighting (ammo counter and firing sound) for a 3D printed Pulse Rifle.

If your Feather doesn't mount up like a flash drive you'll have to follow the instructions to switch the board to circuitpython mode.  Adafruit has all the info.

TO BE DONE:

I2C audio for WAV playback still needs to be implemented
